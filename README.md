# Marketing_Performance_Analysis
This project presents a Marketing Performance Dashboard built using Power BI to derive insights from digital advertising and customer data, including impressions, clicks, conversions and sales performance.

I analyzed the effectiveness of different ad platforms, identified top-performing countries based on sales, tracked customer engagement throughout the day, and highlighted product categories with the highest customer interest.

The goal was to help stakeholders make informed decisions on ad spend optimization, audience targeting, and product marketing strategies by providing a clear view of campaign performance and customer behavior.
